# Base-Library
[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) library for finite types, vectors, retracts, and inhabited types.

This library is based on the library for the lecture ["Introduction to Computational Logics"](https://courses.ps.uni-saarland.de/icl_16/) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/nc/en/home.html).
